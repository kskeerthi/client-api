1. Positive workflow

### App.js is the page which hosts three components such as login, selection of the language and hotels component
# Login page(loginForm.js) ---> Login page with (john and john validation) working along with the validations

# Landing page(Hotelcard.js) --> Showcase of the hotels is completed accoring to the API coming from trv-venue-hotel-api and select the listed hotel

# Hotel detail page(about..js) --> Relevant hotel info and listing of the rooms is completed by validating which are the hotels available and which are not available for selection

# Confirmation page(booking.js) --> Once you select the room, it asks for the details about the stay to carry with payment. With relevant information it shows the amount depending  on the people and the room you choose

# Click on the pay it shows congratulatory message and you can LOGOUT from the application.

# Integrated Google maps with the json data.

# Responsive for mobile and ipads, used media queries to make it responsive

# It Supports multiple languages

# Made simple design based on MVP, it can be scaled further with new design initiatives

# Search and filter functionality are working well
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Negative workflow / Rough edges that can be scaled further

# Admin View is not included in MVP

# API data is not integrated with google maps

# Form validation is not handled on Confirmation page after selecting the room

# Internationalization is enabled only for certain parts of the site 

# Few CSS for text boxes and forms is not done
